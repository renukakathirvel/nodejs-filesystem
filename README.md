NodeJS File System Task
This repository is created for NodeJS File System

This application creates a web server on port 8000 with two endpoints.

/: Provides instructions to visit /write endpoint to save the current timestamp.

/write: Saves the current timestamp to a file named dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.txt.

The root endpoint generates a text file in a folder named Current_TimeStamp containing the current timestamp and sends its content as a response.

The /getTextFiles endpoint retrieves and returns a list of all text files in the same folder.

NodeJS
It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.
ExpressJS
